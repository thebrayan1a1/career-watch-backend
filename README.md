# Welcome to Career Watch

#### 👉🏻 Task List ✅

- Development of REST API with Java and Spring-Boot.
- Create Postgre Database on AWS RDS.
- Creating filters with regular expressions and JPA/Hibernate rules.
- Role based securize architecture. 
- Users validation with JWT. 
- API documentation on Swagger3.
- Endpoints and services fully tested. 
- Deployed on AWS Lambda through AWS api gateway.
- Containerization in docker to run locally.

#### 👉🏻 Code Standards 📜
- Keep in mind rules from [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
- Code must be in English.
- The controllers should finish with suffix "Controller". Example: UserController.
- The services should finish with suffix "Service". Example: UserService.
- The repositories should finish with suffix "Repository". Example: UserRepository.
- The implementations of interfaces should finish with suffix "Impl". Example: UserServiceImpl.
- The DTOs should finish with suffix "Dto". Example: UserDto, UserRequestDto.
- Usage of DTOs is a must. Can have DTOs for request and response.
- Package names are in singular.
- The names of attributes/fields from Java classes must be written using camel case. Example: firstName.
- The name of columns in the entities must be written using underscore and uppercase. Example: FIRST_NAME. The name of the tables is always in plural, but the entity name should be in singular.
- Exceptions should be handled by an implementation of ControllerAdvice. 
- Messages to user can't be hardcoded them should be handled. Some refs [here](https://looksok.wordpress.com/2014/07/05/string-externalization-in-spring-3-1-with-messagesource-no-web-xml/) and [here](https://zetcode.com/spring/messagesource/). 
- If you add a new endpoint, make sure to set the role access for it in the WebSecurity class.

## ✔ WorkFlow 

#### 👉🏻 Commits Format 📜
- Always create the branch from develop 
- The branch name format is: `feature/{jiraTicket#}`.
- The pull request title format is: `{jiraTicket#}: {jiraTitle}`. 
- The commits format is: `{jiraTicket#}: {commitDescription}`, Small commits are a nice to have.
- The pull request has to contain only the changes related to the scope defined in the ticket.
- Pull request should always be from your current branch to develop.

#### 👉🏻 Branches Format 📜
In the current repository you will see three diferent branches
- `main` -> this branch is only for productive versions, it has official release history.
- `develop` -> this branch serves as an integration branch for features. All features must start from this branch and after it's finished it gets merged back into develop.
For understanding more about git and how to work with different branches, I recommend to read about Gitflow workflow. [Here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) you have a little explanation that can serve as introduction.

#### 👉🏻 Scrum 🤝
- Sprints last one week.
- Two mandatory meetings with team leader per sprint.
- The maximum duration of the daily meeting is 15 min.
- Tasks without an epic are not allowed.
- Epics have to be backed by user stories.
- Tasks have to be assigned according to estimate.
